<h1 id="easylogger"><img alt="" src="res/icon.png" /> EasyLogger</h1>
<p><strong>EasyLogger</strong> displays and records data from a microcontroller,
with <em>dual-channel</em> version of the <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/easylogger.html">EasyLogger</a> firmware.
Dual-channel version of the firmware was developed by <em>Yves Lebrac</em> and published
in <a href="http://yveslebrac.blogspot.ru/2008/10/cheapest-dual-trace-scope-in-galaxy.html">his blog</a>
back in 2008. A little more information is available at the
<a href="http://codeandlife.com/2012/02/22/v-usb-with-attiny45-attiny85-without-a-crystal/">Code and Life</a>.
The firmware uses the <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html">V-USB</a> library.</p>
<p>Files:</p>
<pre><code>File to start the program:      EasyLogger.pyw
Settings file:                  config.py
Dependencies:                   Windows, Python 3, PyQt4, PyLab (optional)
</code></pre>
<p>Folders:</p>
<pre><code>img/                            folder for the images to be saved
log/                            folder for recording data (.log)
res/                            program resources (necessary modules)
__pycache __/                   Python bytecode
</code></pre>
<p>Settings are described in the settings file.</p>

<p>Maximum resolution — about 1000 samples per second.</p>

<pre><code>Single click                - drag the window
Double click                - channel switching [1,2], [1], [2], [2/1]
Right click                 - save a picture to the img/ folder
Wheel                       - change speed of data acquisition and update window
                              (the change occurs at the end of a current phase,
                              so it is necessary to wait long delays sometimes)

Escape                      - hide program to tray
Space                       - clear window
1                           - show first channel
2                           - show second channel
3                           - [1,2] channels

/                           - XY-mode, first channel - X, second - Y
*                           - XY-mode, first channel - Y, second - X
</code></pre>
<h2 id="files">Files</h2>
<p>Names of images to be stored have the format:</p>
<pre><code>YYYY-MM-DM--HH-mm-ss.mss-[C]-[CR].png

    - .mss  - milliseconds,
    - [C]   - a list of channels displayed while saving, top to bottom,
    - [CR]  - resolution of channels (time between the vertical lines or dots)
</code></pre>
<p>Names of <code>.log</code>-files are about the same. Averaged by <code>avg_by</code> measurements data is written into a file in the foramt of:</p>
<pre><code>time in seconds &lt;TAB&gt; value of 1st channel &lt;TAB&gt; value of 2nd channel
</code></pre>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>The settings are edited in a text editor such as <strong>Notepad++</strong>.
By double-clicking the <code>config.py</code>, ordinary notepad opens with the file itself.</p>
<p>After changing the settings, you need to restart the program.</p>
<p>You can run multiple instances of the program at the same time.</p>
<p>There is a script <code>res/pylab_plot.py</code>, which plots graphs using data from <code>.log</code>-file.
Several keys were assigned to run the script with different parameters:</p>
<pre><code>P           - channel 1 time plot
Shift + P   - channel 2 time plot
N           - channels 1 and 2, reduced to one

X           - channel 1 - as Y, channel 2 - as X
Shift + X   - channel 2 - as Y, channel 1 - as X

H           - histogram of distribution of channel 1
Shift + H   - histogram of distribution of channel 2

L           - regression channel 1(channel 2)
Shift + L   - regression channel 2(channel 1)

C           - channel 1 and channel 1 as regression of channel 2
Shift + C   - channel 2 and channel 2 as regression of channel 1

D           - channel 1 without channel 1(Channel 2)
Shift + D   - channel 2 without channel 2(channel 1)

J           - histogram of channel 1 across the regression line
Shift + J   - histogram of channel 2 across the regression line

F           - spectrum of channel 1 (DFT)
Shift + F   - spectrum of channel 2 (DFT)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pylab_plot.py</code> script works only with <strong>PyLab</strong> python library installed.
<em>It is = NumPy + Matplotlib + six + dateutil + pyparsing. So, everything is difficult,
especially when you're on 64-bit version of Python.</em></p>
<h1 id="in-the-theory">In the theory</h1>
<p>Data packets are read from the controller by <code>N</code> values per iteration.
Speed of obtaining the packets — <code>1000/N</code> per second. The packets then
put into the buffer, so that all obtained data is available simultaneously.</p>
<p>The graph is drawn by stripes (or dots) one pixel wide. The height of a stripe
is proportional to the current value. The value is calculated as the average
of <code>k</code> samples. So that at one moment the buffer contains <code>L/k</code> <em>stripes</em>,
wherein <code>L</code> is the total amount of untreated data.</p>
<p>You can render all <code>L/k</code> stripes or only the latest <code>n</code>. If there is too much
data in the buffer and not enough time to redraw it, then a part of the data is removed.</p>
<p>Settings <code>N</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>n</code> are called <code>read_samples</code>, <code>draw_by</code> and <code>latest_n</code> respectively.
And, like, used for changing the quantity and quality of data rendered on a broad range.</p>
<p>For example, you can read 100 samples instantly at the end of a minute ​​and then display them as one point,
or you can read 100 samples periodically during one minute and then display them as a one point.</p>
