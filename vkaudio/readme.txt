To install the script:
	1. download the 'vkaudio.zip' by clicking it's name above and then 'View Raw' link,
	2. change it's extension to '.crx',
	3. open 'chrome://extensions/' in your Google Chrome browser and then

	You'll be asked whether you want to install the Chrome Extension, so you know what you should do next :)

	Or so.
